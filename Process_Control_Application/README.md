Created application is a tool that supports the control of the manufacturing process of
of castings. It was designed to monitor and optimize various stages of
 production, using modern machine learning technologies and
precise predictive models.
 The use of algorithms such as Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM, allows the
 application to effectively identify anomalies in production data.

 The chemical composition prediction module uses a neural network with a developed
model that is specifically designed to analyze cycle data,
such as number of cycles, minimum and maximum temperature

The technical implementation of the application includes a backend written in JavaScript with
Python elements and a frontend implemented using React. JavaScript is
responsible for handling the application logic and communication with the database, while Python
is used to implement machine learning algorithms and a prediction model of the
chemical composition
